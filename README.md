# WX-Alerts

Just a small script I'm testing for my husband. He loves to keep track of weather in the various places we've lived, so I want to set up an alert that will text him any time there is a major weather event in any of those places.

I'm using email to text him (the email address I created for my Align Bank project, lol), which is a pretty great way to avoid having to use an SMS api :)
